# todoList
https://luizzitol.github.io/todoList/

This is a simple learning proyect. It uses Node js and MongoDB with Mongoose on the backend and React with React-router-dom on the front end.

You can add any todos by clicking add or pressing enter and you can delete them by just clicking on them.

You can add as many to-do lists by just changing the route, so by default you will be routed to /Today but you could go to /Home, /Work, or anything you want.

This is my first full-stack proyect :)
